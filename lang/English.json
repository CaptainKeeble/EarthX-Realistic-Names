  "ex_droneships": "<m>WHAT ARE DRONESHIPS?</m> \nThey are required if you want to Land with a Rocket that flies to <m>Geostationary Orbit (GEO)</m>, or if the Rocket fairing is <m>85% FULL (has 4 or more slots)</m>. \nYou will be able to Buy, Name, and Move them around the world in the <m>VEHICLES WINDOW</m>.",
